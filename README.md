# Secret-Scribe
This is an open-source project implementing AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption and decryption in [programming language you're using, e.g., C#]. It allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt files and messages using a user-defined key and optional initialization vector (IV).

**Features:**

* Implements AES-128, AES-192, and/or AES-256 encryption (specify which key sizes you support).
* Supports both file and text encryption/decryption.
* User-friendly interface for selecting files, entering keys/IVs, and choosing encryption/decryption mode.
* Secure key management (optional: if you have specific key handling mechanisms).

**Benefits:**

* Learn about the AES algorithm and its secure encryption capabilities.
* Securely encrypt files and messages for personal use or educational purposes.
* Experiment with different key sizes and encryption modes (if applicable).

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/aes-encrypt-decrypt](https://github.com/nishant32400/Secret-Scribe`
4. Follow the prompts to select files/text, enter keys/IVs, and choose the mode.
