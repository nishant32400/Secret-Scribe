# Secret-Scribe
This is an open-source Python project implementing Caesar cipher encryption and decryption. It allows users to easily encrypt and decrypt messages using a user-defined shift value.

**Features:**

* Encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar cipher algorithm.
* User-friendly interface for entering messages and shift values.
* Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
* Handles punctuation and spaces (optional: you can choose to keep them or remove them during encryption/decryption).

**Benefits:**

* Learn about the Caesar cipher and its principles.
* Simple tool for experimenting with basic encryption and decryption techniques.
* Can be used for educational purposes or fun, personalized communication.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher`
2. Install dependencies (if any): `pip install requirements.txt` (replace with your actual command if needed)
3. Run the script: `python caesar_cipher.py`
4. Follow the prompts to enter your message and shift value.
